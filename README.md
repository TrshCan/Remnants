# Remnants

**Remnants** is a text-based online RPG inspired by the atmosphere of *Elden Ring*, the system-driven runs of *King God Castle*, and classic PC RPGs.

The game focuses on **commitment, consequence, and adaptation** rather than fast reflexes or visual spectacle.  
All gameplay is delivered through text, with combat resolved server-side and presented as a living log of events.

## Core Ideas

- **Text-first design**  
  No sprites, no animations. Clarity, tone, and implication carry the experience.

- **Action Point (AP) combat**  
  Players act with a limited pool of Action Points. Over-commitment leads to penalties, delayed recovery, and narrative consequences.

- **Server-authoritative logic**  
  The server resolves all combat and state. The client only sends intent.

- **Fragmented storytelling**  
  Story is discovered through actions, items, NPC reactions, and repeated failure — not exposition.

- **Online, but restrained**  
  Shared presence, instance-based zones, and scoped interaction. Not a traditional MMO.

Remnants is not about power fantasy.

You are not a hero.
You are what is left.
